# DS-Notes-from-Basics

This repository contains my **personal notes and practice files** as I learn Data Science and Python from the basics.

These files are mainly:
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Practice exercises
- Topic-wise notes (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OOP, etc.)
- Small experimental scripts

### 📌 Purpose
These notes are **not structured as a course** or professional documentation.  
They are simply my **private practice notes**, created for learning, revision, and experiments.

### 📁 Projects Folder
Inside the `PROJECTS` folder, you will find small practice projects.

Most of the datasets used are:
- Random datasets from **YouTube tutorials**
- Datasets downloaded from **public sources**
- Self-made or manually collected data
- Trial data for learning purposes

These projects are not intended to be production-grade , they are just practical exercises while learning.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
- The code, notes, and datasets are for **personal learning only**.
- This repository may contain incomplete, experimental, or unoptimized code.
- Dataset sources vary and may not be included or documented fully because they are used only for practice.

### ✔️ Status
I update this repository regularly as I study more topics and work on new exercises.  
Expect frequent commits and changes.
